How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  To develop software that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I focus on creating modular and transferable components. For instance, the CRUD module used in Project Three can be seamlessly integrated into Projects One and Two for handling database operations such as reading, updating, and deleting data. This modular approach not only accelerates development but also simplifies troubleshooting and maintenance.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  To approach software development from a computer science perspective, I rely heavily on critical thinking. I begin by analyzing the problem to fully understand the requirements. Once the requirements are clear, I evaluate potential solutions and determine the most effective approach. I then design test cases with defined pass and fail criteria for each requirement. These test cases guide the development process, allowing me to build tools that directly address the challenges, implement the necessary functionality, and debug the application effectively. I will continue using this structured method to create high-quality software.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  I prefer to begin with a high-level understanding of what needs to be built, using a top-down, requirements driven approach rather than jumping straight into coding individual components from the bottom up. I've found that starting with code too early often leads to unnecessary rework as functions evolve such as needing to change parameters or return types because the overall structure and requirements weren't clearly defined from the start.
